# Messages-Project

This project creates a linked list of Message objects, the message object includes a name for the person and an ID for that message. It will read the actions, names and IDs from a txt file.
If the action is “Receive” a new message object will be added to the linked list.
If the action is “Delete” an ID will be input and the message with that ID will be deleted.
If the action is “List” and a name, all the messages for that person will be outputted.
If the action is “All” all the messages in the linked list will be outputted.
